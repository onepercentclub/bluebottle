        Dear {{ receiver_name }},

        Unfortunately the deadline of your task is reached and no volunteers
        have applied.
        <br><br>
        You can change the status and deadline of the task and keep on searching
        for volunteers.
        <br><br>
        Thanks again and we hope to see you back on {{ site_name }} soon!
