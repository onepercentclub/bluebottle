Dear {{ receiver_name}},

Unfortunately the deadline of your task is reached and no members have applied...

You now have two options:
1. Option 1. Change the status and deadline and start your campaign! Find a colleague with that unique skill that you need and sell this task(s)! You can always ask your local connector for tips & tricks.
2. Option 2. Relax and do nothing. Your tasks will close automatically.

You can edit your task at {{ site }}{{ edit_link }}

Thanks again and we hope to see you back on <Bluebottle Project> soon!

Warm regards,

{% endblocktrans %}
