Dear {{receiver_name}},<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, with your help the task <a href="{{site}}{{link}}">{{ task_title }}</a> from the <a href="{{site}}{{project_link}}">{{project_title}}</a> is realised.<br/><br/>

What a great job you did! You’ve contributed to a happier and healthier destination!
<br/><br/>
Share your story on the <Bluebottle Project> platform; go to the project you’ve participated in and post your story on the wall. Pictures are worth a 1000 words, so add those lovely images, if you have them.
<br/><br/>
Thanks again and we hope to see you back on <Bluebottle Project> soon… Have a look <a href="{{site}}{{task_list}}">here</a> for the currently open tasks at <Bluebottle Project>.
<br/><br/>
Warm regards,
<br/><br/>
