Dear {{ receiver_name }},

Yes, yes … your task {{ task_title }} from the project {{ project_title }} is realised

<strong>Please confirm the participations of member(s)</strong>
Have all accepted members participated in your task? If you confirm that they were part of the task & project their status will change to ‘realised’. All participants will also receive an email to evaluate the activity. Confirm members.

Go to task: {{ site }}{{link}}

<strong>Was this the final task? If so, there are two options:</strong>
Option 1. Create a new task and keep on caring! For example when it is possible to do it again next year. Always check the status and deadline of your project! Go to {{site}}{{project_link}} to create a new task.

Option 2. Are you sure that everything is done? Change the status of your project to ‘realised’ and evaluate your Cares experience by visiting {{site}}{{edit_project_link}}.

Oops. Is it too early to celebrate? You can always change the deadline or status of your task(s). Close your task if it hasn’t been realised by changing the status into ‘closed’. Or change the deadline if the task has not been realised yet. Edit your task at {{site}}{{link}}/edit.

Was this not the last task from your project? Keep up the good work!

Best,


{{ site.name }}
