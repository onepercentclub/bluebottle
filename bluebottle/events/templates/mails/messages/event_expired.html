Hi {{ recipient_name }},
<br><br>
Unfortunately, nobody joined your event “{{ event_title }}”. That’s why we have cancelled the event. 
<br><br>
Don’t worry, you can always edit the event and try again. Need some tips to make your event stand out? Reach out to the platform manager by replying to this email.
