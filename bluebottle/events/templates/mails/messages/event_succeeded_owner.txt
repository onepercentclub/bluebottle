Hi {{ recipient_name }},

Well done, your event "{{ event_title }}" has succeeded. Congratulations!

A couple of things we would like to ask from you:
1. Add your impact results
2. Post an update to celebrate with the people who helped you out

Hi {{ recipient_name }},

You did it! Your event "{{ event_title }}" was marked 'successful',
which means you successfully completed your event. That calls for a celebration.

Why not post something on the activity page to update everyone who participated,
so you can celebrate together. Make sure the email notification is turned on, so all attendees
will be notified of the update.
