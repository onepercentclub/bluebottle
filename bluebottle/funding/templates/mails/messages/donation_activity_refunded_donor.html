            Hi {{ recipient_name }},
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, the campaign "{{ title }}" did not reach its goal. Therefore, all donations will be fully refunded within 10 days.
            <br><br>
            If you have any questions, you can contact the platform manager by replying to this email.
