            We have received some feedback on your identity verification. <br/>
            Please check out the comments and make the appropriate changes. 
            <br/><br/>
            When you’re ready, you can submit your identity verification again and we’ll make sure it’s reviewed.

            If you fail to complete your identity verification we won't be able to payout your crowdfunding campaign.
            All donations will be returned to your supporters!
