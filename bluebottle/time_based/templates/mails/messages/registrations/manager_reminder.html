          This is a reminder to check the list of participants for your activity, "{{ title }}".
          Itâ€™s a good time to make sure everything is up-to-date and that everyone on the list is still active.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you see any changes, like participants who are no longer involved, please update their status.
          This will ensure the correct hours are reported.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you!</p>
