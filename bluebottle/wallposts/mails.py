"""
The prescribed mail flow is as follows:

1) Wallposts created

    a) send email to Object owner, if Wallpost author is not the Object owner (except if he already got an email via 2c).

2) Reaction created on Wallpost

    a) send email to Object owner, if Reaction author is not the Object ower.
    b) send email to Wallpost author, if Reaction author is not the Wallpost author.
    c) send email to other Reaction authors that are not the Object owner or the Wallpost author (they already get an
       email, see above).

Example::

    Object by A
    |
    +-- Wallpost by B
        |
        +-- Reaction by C


Basically, everyone in the tree gets an email if a new Wallpost or Reaction is created, except the author if the newly
created Wallpost or Reaction. But, every unique person shall receive at most 1 email.
