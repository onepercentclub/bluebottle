## 🔄 How to Use

### Viewing the Visualization

1. Open `deed_states_visualization/index.html` in any web browser
2. Click on any state to explore it
3. Follow the clickable links to navigate between states
4. Use the back button to return to the overview

### Regenerating After Changes

If the state machine code changes:

```bash
# Regenerate Deed state pages
python3 generate_deed_state_pages.py

# Regenerate DeedParticipant state pages  
python3 generate_participant_state_pages.py
```

The scripts will overwrite existing files with updated information.

## 🎓 Key Insights from Documentation

### Deed Lifecycle Patterns

1. **Happy Path:**
   ```
   draft → publish → open → succeed → succeeded
   ```

2. **Review Path:**
   ```
   draft → submit → submitted → approve → open → succeed → succeeded
   ```

3. **Failure Paths:**
   - No participants: `open → expire → expired`
   - Cancelled: `open → cancel → cancelled`
   - Rejected: `submitted → reject → rejected`

4. **Recovery Paths:**
   - From expired/cancelled/rejected: `restore → needs_work`
   - From succeeded/expired: `reopen_manually → draft`

### Participant Lifecycle Patterns

1. **Happy Path:**
   ```
   create → initiate → accepted → succeed → succeeded
   ```

2. **Withdrawal:**
   ```
   accepted → withdraw → withdrawn → reapply → accepted
   ```

3. **Removal:**
   ```
   accepted → remove → rejected → accept → accepted
   ```

### Automatic Behaviors

1. **Date-driven transitions:**
   - When start date passes: participants automatically succeed
   - When end date passes: activity succeeds (if has participants) or expires (if no participants)

2. **Cascading effects:**
   - When activity succeeds: all participants succeed
   - When activity is cancelled: organizer fails
   - When last participant is removed from finished activity: activity expires

3. **Bidirectional relationships:**
   - Participant success can trigger activity success
   - Activity state changes can trigger participant state changes
   - Date changes reschedule all effort contributions
