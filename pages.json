Individuals, associations, schools, foundations and businesses&hellip;everybody is welcome to start or join a do-good campaign and change the world!\u200b</p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">What are the criteria?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Our team checks every initiative proposal carefully to see if it meets the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your initiative contributes to a better world.</li>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;re able to show us how you plan to work together on activities and spend the money raised (with an itemised budget)&nbsp;in your initiative and activity descriptions.</li>\r\n<li>The goal of your initiative is not to convert people&rsquo;s faiths and does not involve any sort of activism (religious or political).</li>\r\n<li>Your initiative is not for personal gain.</li>\r\n<li>Your initiative cannot fund or support criminal - or any illegal &ndash; activity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How can&nbsp;I start?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>If you think your initiative fits these criteria, the first step to getting it on the platform is to create a personal account.&nbsp; Now you can apply to start an initiative! The next step is to write and submit your plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s really important to make sure you fill in all the details correctly &ndash; and just as important to think carefully about how you&rsquo;re going to present your project in the best way possible. Convince us &ndash; and the rest of the world &ndash; that your initiative is worth caring about by creating a catchy title and make some nice photos or videos to bring us into your world and show what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you don't finish your initiative right away. Save your details and you&rsquo;ll be able to begin again via 'My Initiatives' the next time you login.</p>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re happy with everything, click 'submit' and we will review your plan. Within 3 working days we'll get back to you with our feedback. If everything is approved, we'll put your campaign online and you can start crowdfunding straightaway.</p>\r\n<p>Remember: you &ndash; and only you - are responsible for promoting and spreading your initiative online and offline with the rest of the world!</p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How do I choose my target amount?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>You choose your own target amount. It's good to be ambitious but stay realistic: A target doesn't have to be exactly the same as how much you need. Make sure you've got a realistic plan with a feasible target amount. To do this, make a list of possible supporters, estimate how much they will support you, and calculate your target amount from these estimates.</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget &ndash; you can always fundraise more (and less) than you hoped!</p>\r\n<p><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">SUPPORT AN INITIATIVE</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How can I support an initiative?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>There are lots of ways to support one of our do-good projects &ndash; here&rsquo;s how you can share your knowledge, time, network, skills or money.</p>\r\n<p>Money - you can support a crowdfunding campaign by donating a minimum amount of &euro;5. As long as you donate more than that, you&rsquo;re free to choose whatever amount you want to give whichever campaign you wish!</p>\r\n<p>Time &amp; Knowledge - you can support initiatives by sharing your skills to help with a specific activity. For example, an initiative might need some financial advice, and you could be the accountant to help them?</p>\r\n<p>Network - you can support a project initiator by setting up a fundraiser and assist him or her in reaching the target amount.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How can I donate money?\u200b\u200b</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s as easy as 1,2,3:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Choose an amount: Once you've selected a campaign to support, click the 'support' button. Now you can choose the amount you want to donate; either click on the set amounts or fill in a specific amount.</li>\r\n<li>Fill in your personal details (if you want): You can donate by creating an account or logging in via Facebook. However, you can skip this step and donate as an anonymous guest.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Choose a payment method: Finally, choose how you want to pay, and follow the payment process provided by DocData Payments or iDeal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>That's it! After you&rsquo;ve paid, you can add a short message of encouragement for the project initiator to give him or her an extra boost &ndash; and give yourself a pat on the shoulder too!</p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">How do I set up a fundraiser?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>A fundraiser is a great way to raise support and awareness for a crowdfunding campaign. Whatever you do, whether it&rsquo;s asking people to donate to a project as a present for your birthday, organising a benefit dinner or going the whole way and running a marathon, it will raise funds for a project you care about.</p>\r\n<p>The even better news is that it takes less than two minutes to create your own fundraiser page. Go to the project you would like to fundraise for, click on the right side of the project page, punch in a catchy title, short description, upload a photo or video and choose a target amount and deadline.&nbsp;Then all you have to do is start fundraising!</p>\r\n<p>With this personal fundraiser page you can invite your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues to support you. Just in case you were wondering, it&rsquo;s completely free to create a fundraiser page and every donation will be directly transferred to your chosen project.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Is every project checked before it's put online?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Absolutely! Once an initiative plan has been submitted, our team checks it carefully to see if the proposal meets the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your initiative contributes to a better world</li>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;re able to show us - with an itemised budget &ndash; how you plan to spend the money raised, right up to your target amount, via your campaign.</li>\r\n<li>The goal of your campaign is not to convert people&rsquo;s faiths and does not involve any sort of activism (religious or political).</li>\r\n<li>Your campaign is not for personal gain.</li>\r\n<li>Your campaign cannot fund criminal - or any illegal - activity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">TECHNICAL QUESTIONS</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">Which browsers does GoodUp support?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>For the best site experience, GoodUp recommends using one of the supported browsers and versions listed below.</p>\r\n<p>Using older browser versions may prevent you from accessing to the platform.
